# OO Javascript Linked list!


By [Liam Buell](https://github.com/Lbuell/)

## Deduplicate a linked list
----

Start with a doubly-linked list of 200 nodes with random values between 1 and 100. Now remove any nodes as required, so that each value is only in the list no more than one time.

#### An example with values less than 10: 

Input:

      8 <=> 4 <=> 2 <=> 4 <=> 9 <=> 4 <=> 8 <=> 8 <=> 0 <=> 3

Output:

      8 <=> 4 <=> 2 <=> 9 <=> 0 <=> 3
      
 

Phase 2:

What's the algorithm for solving this with no auxiliary data structure? Can you implement it? What's the Big O for this approach?



## Installation

Fork and clone the repo and rackup in console! then open the console in your browser to watch the javascript run the linked list.   You can really put any ruby code you want in the application.rb file, you just need to run rake build before you run rackup to rebuild the JS

## Information

  A small Opal app that turns a Ruby LL into a OO Javascript Linked list.    There are two files for this assignment, the first is with an array and the 2nd is without
